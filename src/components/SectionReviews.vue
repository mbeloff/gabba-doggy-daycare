It definitely is, our little man loves coming here and he starts getting so excited when we open the door. Best thing is you get updates throughout the day too üòä',

            review: 'Love, love, love!! I am over the moon with the love and play our beautiful fur babies receive from the GDDC Owner, the Manager and the beautiful girls who take such great care with our precious cargo. I still can‚Äôt believe I found wonderful GDDC, a great day‚Äôs play with always something new to see here at 46 Deshon Street Woolloongabba. üíìüíì When my Pippa joined GDDC, I took advantage of an offer of a free trial and we haven‚Äôt looked back since. If you would like to make sure your fur baby is in capable and kind hands, take advantage of the current free trial offer. GDDC also have a Pet Taxi Service, one could not ask for anything more. üåπüê∂',
