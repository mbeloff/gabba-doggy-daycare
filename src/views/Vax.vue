          <p class="mb-4">Vaccinations are important to protect your dog and stop the spread of contagious illnesses and diseases. This is especially important in a doggy daycare and other spaces where many dogs are interacting.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">As we love to see all our guests happy, safe and healthy, we require everyone to be up to date with their vaccinations before they can book in for daycare.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We ask that dogs are protected against the following:</p>
        <ul class="list-none list-inside ml-4 font-bold text-left mb-4">           
           <ListItem>Distemper</ListItem>
           <ListItem>Hepatitus</ListItem>
           <ListItem>Parvovirus</ListItem>
           <ListItem>Bordetella and Parainfluenza (Kennel/Canine Cough)</ListItem>
          </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">All these are covered by a <em>C5</em> Vaccination, or a combination of <em>C3</em> and <em>KC</em> vaccination. We recommend speaking with your regular vet if you're unsure whether your dog's vaccinations are up-to-date, as we will request evidence of their vaccinations before you can schedule daycare with us (and again as your dog requires his/her yearly booster to stay protected).</p>
        <p class="font-bold ">If you have any questions about our vaccination policy, just send a quick email to  <a class="text-pink-500 hover:underline" href="mailto:woof@gabbadoggydaycare.com">woof@gabbadoggydaycare.com</a> we'll get back to you.</p>
